OVERVIEW
==========================================================================

This is Project 5 of Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree Program - an item
catalog web application on Ubuntu virtual server. The catalog application
is the same application I used in Project 3 (Personal Budget application)
but configured to work on the new Ubuntu environment and thus publically
accessible via a web browser.

==========================================================================
HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION
==========================================================================

-- Open a web browser and navigate to:
   http://52.88.13.168 

-- Read the brief instructions provided on the home page to understand
   what the application does and how to use it.

-- Login in one of two ways - either using a Google account (if you 
   already have one) or using the local login method. If you use 
   the local method, be sure to register your account first.

==========================================================================
HOW TO SSH INTO THE SERVER
==========================================================================

-- Please email me to obtain the private key - adilbekm@yahoo.com

-- Place the private key in file 'udacity_key_grader' in directory .ssh
   inside your home directory on your machine.

-- Login to the server with command:
   ssh grader@52.88.13.168 -p 2200 -i ~/.ssh/udacity_key_grader
   
==========================================================================
HOW TO SETUP THE SERVER AND APPLICATION
==========================================================================

The setup process I used to configure the server and the application is
based on the steps provided in "How will I complete this project?"
in the instructions for this Project 5.
