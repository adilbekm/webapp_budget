OVERVIEW
==========================================================================

This web application allows you to keep track of your budget and expenses. 

==========================================================================
HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION
==========================================================================

-- Open a web browser and navigate to:
   http://www.adilbek-budget.com 

-- Read the brief instructions provided on the home page to understand
   what the application does and how to use it. (I temporarily removed 
   these from the public page but they can be seen after authenticating)

-- Login in one of two ways - either using a Google account (if you 
   already have one) or using the local login method. If you use 
   the local method, be sure to register your account first.
   Update: I have removed Google Sign In.
