	<p>This application is a great way to track your personal budget and expenses.
	It works as follows: you create a budget period, let's say "June 2015", and then you add
	categories inside it like "Rent" or "Car payment" along with the budgeted
	dollar amounts. As you go through June and spend money, you come here and
	enter your expenses in the corresponding budget categories.</p>
	<p>The application calculates and shows the balance for each category as well as for
	the entire period. At any given time, you can see how well (or how bad) you are doing
	for the period and for each of the categories. Perhaps you are doing great with your
	food expenses this month, and so you can pat yourself on the back and take an extra
	night out with your friends. Or maybe you've overspent on your miscellaneous items
	and therefore should cut back on other categories or plan to spend less next month.
	Whatever the case, this application will help you see your budget in real time
	and help you become smarter about your money.</p>
